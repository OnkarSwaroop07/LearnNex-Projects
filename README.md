## 📌 Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction  

**Objective:**  
Predict whether customers will stop using a service based on their usage patterns and demographic information.  

**Dataset:**  
[Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, SHAP  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Key Steps:**  
✔ **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.  
✔ **Model Training** – Used **Random Forest Classifier** for churn prediction.  
✔ **Evaluation** – Analyzed **accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score**.  
✔ **Feature Importance & SHAP Analysis** – Identified key factors influencing churn.
